# terraform-variable-examples

- Very Simple Examples
- These are just examples and no AWS or Passwords required
- See how the variables & counting works
- See how variables are referenced
- Anything else you would like; let me know
- Feel free to clone this and use them 
- Just something simple and love to share
- A key word in terraform is "interpolation" 
- Planning to look at ways to add helpful comments  

## Testing and Findings 

1. File "important-message-here.txt" that is created includes the message from line 3 of main that grabs variables and publishes them in the this file.

2. Command "terraform show" reveals the plan details at your command.

3. Command "terraform output" shows the files that are the intended output of the terraform programmer.  If the programmer had something that should be seen the programmer would put that here.
